I think the best approach is to ask for clarification: \"Do you want to set up or list MCP servers?\" I want to keep my response concise and friendly. I could also provide steps like explaining MCP, setting up an MCP server, connecting via VS Code/CLI, troubleshooting, and searching for MCP config files in the repo. Let's run a quick search for any \"mcp\" strings!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Running config checks for MCP**\n\nI need to check the repo for any MCP config files. I'll use commands like `rg -n mcp` or `grep -R` to help with that. It seems like a straightforward approach! I'll include a little preamble to clarify for the user: “Let me check the repo for any MCP config.” Once I do that, I can run the shell commands to find what I’m looking for.
